# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

This project presents an end-to-end data science analysis of customer churn in the telecom industry. 
The goal is to identify key factors driving churn and provide data-driven recommendations to improve customer retention.

## Business Objective

Customer churn is a major challenge for telecom companies, as acquiring new customers is more expensive than retaining existing ones.  
The primary objective of this project is to analyze customer behavior, identify the key drivers of churn, and build a predictive model to help the business proactively retain high-risk customers.
